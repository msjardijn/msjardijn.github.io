                      oeuvre is characterized by a profound
                      interdisciplinary approach, bringing together art,

                        his artistic education at the Vrije Academie in
                        The Hague from 1966 to 1968, followed by studies
                        at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague from
                        1968 to 1973. His intellectual development was
                        further deepened by his study of cultural
                        sciences at the Open University from 1978 to
                        1981, with a specific focus on philosophy and
                        literature. This combined academic background
                        laid the foundation for his ability to connect
                        aesthetics with theoretical reflection, through
                        which he seeks to bridge the traditional gap

                    <p><span class="selected">A central concept in
                        Martin Sjardijn's thought is his 'Total
                        Idealism'. This concept is addressed in his
                        philosophical texts and poems, which are often
                        inspired by contemporary philosophy and physics.
                        'Total Idealism' can be placed within the
                        broader philosophical tradition of idealism,
                        which posits that reality is primarily mental or
                        consciousness-based, and that ideas represent
                        the highest form of reality.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="selected">Sjardijn's artistic
                        projects are direct manifestations of this
                        philosophical position. His pursuit of
                        'immaterial new objectivity' and 'meta-reality'
                        in 'outer and cyberspace', as well as his focus
                        on 'weightless sculpture', reflect a movement
                        beyond conventional material forms into a purely
                        conceptual or ideal space. The 'zero of 3D-form'
                        in his 'Black Box' project can be
                        philosophically interpreted as a transition to a
                        domain where physical primacy is relinquished.</span></p>

                    <p><span class="selected">Since 1985, Sjardijn has
                        been working on the project "A Line in Outer
                        Space, Visible from Earth , With the naked eye ,
                        At clear nights". This project involves the
                        creation of sculptures that rotate in
                        weightlessness, ideally within CubeSats (small
                        satellites), and are then communicated globally
                        via the internet. The first presentations took
                        place in 1986 at the Gemeentemuseum in The
                        Hague, accompanied by an animation titled "Leeg
                        Vierkant 1986", created in collaboration with
                        astronomer Dr. Wim Bijleveld and the Digistar
                        planetary computer at the Omniversum.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="selected">Sjardijn's interest in
                        weightless sculpture, which emerged in 1984, led
                        to extensive experiments with virtual reality
                        (VR) at Delft University of Technology starting
                        in 1990. Under the supervision of Prof. Erik
                        Jansen and Jouke Verlinden, he experimented with
                        Head Mounted Displays and tactile force feedback
                        datagloves. With the advent of the internet, he
                        further immersed himself in interactive virtual
                        reality, 3D printing techniques, and robotics.
                        In 2000, he developed an interactive virtual
                        museum for the Groninger Museum, and between
                        2010 and 2014, he created the interactive
                        installation "Elements". His ultimate ambition
                        is to place 3D-printed sculptures in
                        weightlessness within a CubeSat, which would
                        then be observed by an internal camera and
                        shared globally via the internet. The project
                        symbolizes a 'meta-reality' and a 'new
                        immaterial global realism', where weightlessness
                        functions as a metaphor for transcending
                        material limitations.</span></p>

                    <p><span class="selected">"Black Box" is another
                        significant project that embodies Sjardijn's
                        thinking. This work is explicitly described as
                        the "spatial successor to Malevich's 'Black
                        Square'". The project begins "from zero, in
                        zero, via virtual reality to the first
                        extraterrestrial weightless sculptures". The
                        intention is to "go beyond the zero of 3D-form
                        and emerge from nothing into a Line, that is,
                        into meta-reality, into the new immaterial
                        global realism in outer and cyberspace to
                        virtual and extraterrestrial creation". Sjardijn
                        extends Malevich's concept of 'zero' to the
                        digital and extraterrestrial domain, aiming for
                        "the experience of immaterial new objectivity in
                        the void of a liberated cultural space". "Black
                        Box" is a radical reinterpretation of modernist
                        abstraction for the 21st century, shedding
                        physical form and embracing the immaterial and
                        interconnected nature of advanced technology and
                        virtual space.</span></p>

                        a pioneering role in the development of digital

                        engagement with technology is not merely
                        instrumental; it is an integral part of his
                        philosophical exploration of the nature of
                        reality and perception. Starting in the 1980s,
                        he began to research new technologies and was
                        one of the first to experiment with VR at Delft

                        Bijleveld on the animation "Leeg Vierkant"
                        (1986). His experiments with VR at TU Delft,
                        which began in 1990, were groundbreaking. His
                        ArtSpaceLab project includes a virtual
                        exhibition and a proposal for an art project on

                        reflects on the changing relationship between
                        humans, art, and technology. His work with VR
                        allows him to experience images as "more
                        contextless than ever and more autonomous than
                        before," which he considers his "legacy from
                        Francis Bacon." This suggests that with VR,
                        Sjardijn achieves a similar effect of isolation
                        and intensification of the visual experience as
                        Bacon, but through technological means. He views
                        technology, particularly VR, not merely as an
                        instrument for creating new forms, but as a
                        philosophical tool that fundamentally changes
                        the relationship between the artwork, its
                        context, and the viewer.</span></p>

                        2011. His approach to painting is
                        process-oriented: "When I paint, I want to be
                        surprised by the brush, The ink, the paint, the
                        linen and the movement of my hand. Linen, brush,
                        paint and ink have their own strength and
                        intelligence. The only thing I want to do is to
                        set a theme as a starting point. On the basis of
                        this, the process can take place". He considers
                        the tension between "crisis and chance" as a
                        "gift." This approach, inspired by Francis Bacon
                        and Tracey Emin, contrasts with the precision
                        and control often associated with his digital
                        projects, but reveals a deeper philosophy that
